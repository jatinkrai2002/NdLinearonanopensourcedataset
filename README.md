## Use Case
# Automated Retinal Image Analysis for Disease Detection:
# Objective: To detect retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration from fundus images.
# Approach: Use NdLinear layers to preserve spatial information and improve diagnostic accuracy.
# Impact: Early detection and treatment of retinal diseases, potentially preventing vision loss and improving patient outcomes.

This project provides a solid foundation for showcasing the capabilities of NdLinear in medical imaging and contribute to open-source ML tooling and research documentation.Â
